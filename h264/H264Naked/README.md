H264Naked is a raw data viewer for H264 video stream.

While working on a video decoding project, I found that video decoders are very picky about video stream's format. For unsupported video streams, those decoders usually don't generate any errors nor frames. As a result, debugging is quite difficult. One effective way I found is dumping raw frame data and comparing it with that of a working video. However, there aren't many options available for dumping the H264 raw info, therefore I wrote this tool. H264Naked is a wrapper around libh264stream.

[h264streamanalysis](http://sourceforge.net/projects/h264streamanalysis) is another similar tool, but only available for windows.
